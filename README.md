# Text Analysis Project

This project automates the extraction and analysis of text from online articles, evaluating various metrics such as sentiment scores, readability, and other textual features. The results are compiled and saved to an Excel file, providing insights into the content of each article.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you on how to get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before running this project, you need to have Python installed on your system (Python 3.x is recommended). You also need to install several Python libraries, which are listed in the dependencies section.

### Installing

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://yourrepositorylink.com/project.git
cd project
```

Next, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas nltk textblob
```

You'll also need to download the necessary NLTK data:

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

### Setting Up Your Environment

Ensure you have an `Input.xlsx` file in the project directory. This file should contain a column of URLs to articles you wish to analyze.

### Running the Script

To run the script, navigate to the project directory in your terminal or command prompt and execute:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```

Replace `your_script_name.py` with the name of the Python script file.
